1. Project name: Just look up!

The title of the film might be different among members in our group as we work on the website individually but overall, we were all working towards the common theme.


2. Project description:

The theme of the video is digital devices obsession. As for the plot, throughout the video, everybody in it is acting obsessed with looking down at their phones, which are so intuitive and addictive. We try to convey that these people are stuck in the digital world, disassociating themselves from reality and avoiding cultivate physical and social connections. This is a harsh reality nowadays all over the globe across people of different generations. Thus, we wish to raise awareness about this problem and encourage people to just look up, even for a short while, to live in the here and now.


3. Process:
- For the video:

We walked around campus and saw a lot of people with their eyes stuck to their phones everywhere we went to. Therefore, we did not have to ask them to pretend they were using their phones; we simply asked for their permission to shoot them. In doing so, we realize that we also help them return to reality for a few seconds as we were having a physical, eye-to-eye conversation on the permission.

Additionally, we intentionally did not capture their faces as we wished to convey to the viewers the reality that when people look at their phones, they cannot see any faces and make any social connections.

In the editing, we add a narrator voice to add more impact in addition to a dramatic, suspenseful, scary soundtrack that connects with how I designed the website.

- For the website:

I want to reflect that this reality is bleak in terms of social connections and reality presence, thus, the black background on all pages. 

I based the colorful decorations of the squishy, curvy lines in the background on the color palette of the familiar Facebook Messenger iOS/Android app since it is one of the most iconic, most used apps for maintaining digital connection. In a fever dream, if those who are obsessed with using the app use that icon as a paintbrush, they would get those squishy, curvy, colorful lines in the background.

Additionally, I would like to implement a “virtual” shock to the users upon interacting with the website for the first time with the “No Internet” sign so as to, hopefully, enhance their experience afterwards. For the next few pages, there are reality-check questions asking users if they love the internet and their phones, a final question asking how they feel after watching the videos and 2 messages from the video we wish to quickly convey to the users. I intentionally do not want users to see the first page as a homepage, but they have to go through all these pages first to hopefully make the website and our video more impactful.


4. Reflection/Evaluation: 

I have asked a few of my friends, including one in our class, and they agreed upon the impact of the first few webpages. The first page delivers a sense of shock and the questions on the next few pages encourage them to ponder. Another classmate in our class commented that she loved the concept layout of the website; it is simple, highly contrasted, evocative, and cohesive. Hence, my goals and expectations were basically met.

As for me, I wanted to add another animation of website further using CSS and JavaScript. I really love the concept of a ghost mouse following the cursor on the screen as I wish to even stress the bleak reality of being obsessed and haunted by the digital devices but the codes were too complicated. I also intended to add a firework effect that would, if users click on the buttons, trigger bunch of tiny Facebook Messenger app icons explode onto the screen with CSS and JavaScript but then I realize that would give away the design of the website.
