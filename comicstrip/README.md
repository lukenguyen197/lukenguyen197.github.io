1. Project name: Into the Woods

2. Project description:
The theme of our comic strip is fairy tale. During the brainstorming session, one of us was watching HBO’s House of the Dragons and we were really excited by the idea of old folktales. We thought about the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood. We grew up learning about these stories, and since we were aiming to go deep into storytelling, we decided to mash up all three elements together into one. The story does not necessarily convey a particular moral message of philosophy, but the sentiment and the undertone of fairytale in itself and the opportunity to revisit some of the classic fairytales are what we were trying to convey, especially now that we are all adults. We realized the story is a little dark as we wanted to deliver a plot twist in the last frame.

3. Process:
We divided the assignment into 3 aspects: drawing, sound design, and web-coding. 

•	For the drawing part: 
Maryam and Rama divided the task into 2. Maryam did the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 8th panels and Rama did the remaining ones in addition to the background for the first page. Both of them used drawing applications on iPad.

Additionally, when I received the drawings, I also added some decorative elements using Photoshop and Illustrator to each panel to make it more appealing as well as to make it fit better inside the comic frames. For example, I added clouds to the 3rd panel, fire to the 5th, and forest to the 6th, 7th, and 8th, besides text bubbles and onomatopoeia elements such as the sound of wind whooshing, the sound of dragon roaring, and the typical “!” used when a comic writer wants to attract the readers to some special elements inside the frame.  

•	For the sound design part:
Maryam recorded the character’s dialogues and I took those to design the sound. As I wanted to deliver a realistic sound of the environment to the readers, I layered a lot of sound elements on top of each other to create a soundscape. For example, in the first panel, there are wind howling, leaves rustling, wolf howling in addition to the general ambience of the woods; in the second panel, there is slight wind whooshing; in the third panel, there is strong wind whooshing, panting. 

Additionally, as I wanted to elevate the comics, I added the dramatic soundtrack from HBO’s Game of Thrones as it ties to the story. Their soundtrack library is extremely big and intense but it was not very hard to pinpoint the track I wanted to use.

I had to find a website to host audio content for streaming and link it back into the JavaScript.

Overall, it was a really painstaking yet enjoyable process.

•	For the web-coding part:
Theyab and I handled it. All of us agreed to go into the traditional route of creating comics, following Scott McCloud’s “Understanding Comics.” Hence, I coded in CSS to create the traditional comic panels. 

Theyab constructed most of the web layout in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

4. Reflection/Evaluation: 
We as a team all agreed that the website looked simple enough for it to have an impact. In a sense, it is traditionally a comic webpage, similar to those that viewers can find across the internet to read comics such as Marvel, DC, or other brands. But it reflects our intention of digitalizing the traditional hand drawn comic strip with added interactivity.

We initially also planned to create a parallax scrolling effect for the first page (the woods and the dragon sleeping) but due to time constraint, we could not create enough materials besides these two elements for the scrolling effect to be visible although Theyab did code the parallax scrolling in JavaScript. Still, we all wanted to elevate our comic page a little bit more with the parallax scrolling not only for the first page but also within each panel as well.
